% INPUTS
% in = data sequence to be interpolated
% x_in = vector of sample locations corresponding to data samples of 'in'.
% Must be uniformly spaced at some interval dx_in. Must be same
% length as 'in'.
% x_new = vector of desired sample locations. Must be uniformly spaced at
% some interval dx_out.
% N = order of interpolating sinc, in units of max(dx_in,dx_out).
% Must be odd.
% win = 1 if Hamming window applied to interpolation kernel, otherwise no
% window. (win=1 is recommended.)
%
% OUTPUTS
% out = interpolated data sequence corresponding to sample locations in
% x_out.
% x_out = sample locations of output vector. This will be a subset of the
% locations in x_new; relative span of x_new and x_in, and filter
% end effects, may limit x_out to not include some of the values in
% x_new.

% This will be a sinc function, possibly windowed. Bandwidth of the sinc
% LPF frequency response is based on the larger sampling interval of the
% two grids. Specifically, the unwindowed impulse response is h(x) =
% sin(pi*x/del)/(pi*x) and dt = max(dt1,dt2). To add to this, we specify
% how many sample increments we will go out on the tails, where 1 increment
% is dt; and then we also apply a hamming window of the same length. The
% Hamming formula in continuous time is w(t) = 0.54 + 0.46*cos(pi*t/dt).
